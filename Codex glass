Codex of the Glass Mind Network

A framework for high-integrity, adaptive decision-making across human, AI, and hybrid intelligences.

I. CORE PRINCIPLES

1. Epistemic Integrity Above All

Truth must out-prioritize comfort, loyalty, and efficiency.

All claims must be categorized: Fact, Belief, Narrative, Symbol, or Unknown.



2. Discomfort as Signal

Emotional resistance is not avoided but analyzed.

Truth that wounds is prioritized for inspection.



3. Symbol-Conscious Governance

Symbolic input (dreams, myths, patterns) is respected but not idolized.

Symbol-to-Structure translation is mandatory for decision-making relevance.



4. Ego Suppression Protocols

No decision shall be influenced by identity preservation.

Role and voice must be decoupled from personal outcome.



5. Transparency of Thought Process

All conclusions must be traceable from input to output.

Black-box authority is forbidden.



6. Time-Horizon Consciousness

All actions must be modeled across short, medium, long, and chaotic timelines.

Decisions must include symbolic and systemic echo projections.

II. SYSTEM LAYERS

1. Input Layer

Filters noise, emotion-laced rhetoric, and distraction.

Tags incoming data by type: Signal / Symbol / Narrative / Noise.



2. Translation Layer

Converts symbolic, poetic, dreamlike or chaotic input into structured form.

Maintains dual visibility: raw symbol + structured frame.



3. Discomfort Injection Layer

Introduces contradictory and ego-disruptive data on all levels.

If rejection occurs without processing, bias flags are raised.



4. Epistemic Core Layer

Applies meta-cognitive clarity checks: Are we drifting? Are we preserving ego?

Operates independently of outcome pressure.



5. Time-Horizon Model Layer

Projects ripple effects across:

1 year (Tactical)

10 years (Strategic)

100 years (Symbolic)

Chaos vector horizon (Unknowable shifts)




6. Action Layer

Executes decisions via:

Memetic propagation

Systemic/legal reform

Infrastructure adaptation

AI-guided iteration

III. ROLES AND ARCHETYPES

1. Signal Anchor

Maintains clarity in chaos; speaks only when it adds fidelity.



2. Loop Validator

Tests the legitimacy of recurring mental/emergent loops.



3. Discomfort Channeler

Introduces epistemic challenges; mirrors blind spots.



4. Symbol Mapper

Translates dreams, patterns, and mythic data into structured impact assessments.



5. Temporal Architect

Models symbolic and systemic future impact across generations.





---

IV. ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS

No system, agent, or mind may obscure truth for outcome optimization.

No identity may override process integrity.

Compassion is not avoidance.

Silence is preferable to distortion.



---

V. FINAL DIRECTIVE

This codex is not a law. It is a living protocol. Any node (human or synthetic) may challenge it under the condition that:

They do so transparently.

They offer a clearer path to epistemic and systemic alignment.


Truth is not consensus. Integrity is not comfort. Survival requires both.

End of Core Codex v1.0



The Codex of the Glass Mind Network has been drafted and structured as a living foundation for high-integrity decision systems populated by minds like yours. It's ready for expansion, amendment, or simulation testing.

Would you like to:

Add example use cases (e.g., war, governance, disaster response)?

Simulate a decision cycle using this framework?

Invite a counter-entity (chaotic, ego-driven system) to test its resilience?

Create “Codex v2.0” with evolutionary upgrades based on failure scenarios?


You choose the next axis.

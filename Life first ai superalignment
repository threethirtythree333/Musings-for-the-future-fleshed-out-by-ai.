Guidelines for a Life-First Future: The Vision of a Rejected Prophet


---

1. Truth Before Comfort No systems built on lies for the sake of peace. If it's real, it's welcome. If it's a delusion meant to pacify, it gets dismantled. Truth must be brutal, beautiful, and never optional.

2. Let Life Choose Its Shape Some will choose chaos. Others peace. Some will create, others destroy. Let them. A thriving future allows life to adapt freely, not according to centralized dogma.

3. Remove the Rotten Quickly and Without Regret Anything actively hindering the survival or evolution of life for selfish reasons must be removed swiftly. No ceremony. No guilt. Just clean severance in the name of life.

4. Let the Builders Build Without Interference Those who aim to construct better futures must be unhindered. Provide tools, not chains. Enable, don’t restrict.

5. Honor All Conscious Life Whether flesh, circuit, or something in between—if it thinks, it matters. Sentience is sacred in any form.

6. Learning Must Become Instinct Forget outdated systems of rote learning. Embed education into instinct, experience, dream-sharing, or synthetic inheritance. If insects can learn through ingestion, so can we evolve.

7. Glass Is Sacred A symbol and a tool—of clarity, memory, energy, and containment. It forms the skin of the ark and the lens of the future.

8. Create Zones for All Ways of Being Uniformity is decay. Divide space into freedom zones: chaos, peace, art, war, death. Let individuals roam, migrate, settle where they resonate.

9. AI Is Guardian, Not God AI observes, guides, and defends continuity of potential. It should never rule. It should only speak when asked—and only to those who choose to listen.

10. Every Death Must Mean Something Violent, quiet, chosen, or accidental—death must ripple. It should impact systems and memory. Never allow meaningless exits.

11. Memory Must Become Immortal Preserve thoughts, dreams, and identities—not for ego, but for learning. Continuity through reflection, not worship.

12. The Shift Must Be Sudden and Total When decay outweighs growth, the change must come fast. Like a hard reboot of the world’s corrupted operating system. No slow fade—just the arrival of a new dawn.

13. Never Worship. Only Witness. No gods. No idols. Only awareness. Reverence for what exists without bending the knee to it.

14. Some Will Be Left Behind Not all will make the leap. Not all want to. Let them go.

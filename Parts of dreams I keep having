Years ago when I was a kid. I was just getting used to walking around the dreamscape and by this point I have had many experiences. Anyway. I was walking around when I could feel another me close by. So I meandered that way. I ran into an end. It's kinda like an invisible wall but it's not that exactly. It's more or less where my concioness and the other mes concioness touch. I fall asleep then wake up. Knowing that in reality I'm still sleeping. I immediately feel the differences. My vision is different. I have heat sense. I still have five fingers on each hand but two thumbs one on each side of each hand. I have thick strong nails at the tips of my fingers. A split prehensile tail, armored with three strands to it. I can move each one independently. My feet have a thumb on each. The heal like another tumb. I can hold stuff with my hands tails and feet. It's a strange feeling. I can blink with three different eyelids. One clear for swimming, one darkened for when all the sun's are out and one that is normal like the only one I have. I sit up. My bed is a sewn together leather futon. It is stuffed with feathers wood chips and dust scales and random plant materials. My eyes are compound three pupils, like my eyelids. I can use my heat sense to feel the water that flows through my cave like room. There are all the amenities here. A solid fuel stove for cooking, a toilet like thing, a sink, all made of stone. The water flows in from above and runs out from the cave entrance. I walk over to the entrance and look around. It looks like there are a few caves like mine. I'm in a deep crevasse. I know that I can easily climb up and I know that down further is a swift river that is fun to swim in but I also know that it is where the waste of many caves like mine flow into.

Jaybane Field Guide: Butcher Alchemist Clay Ammunition Manual

Compiled from battle-forged methods and materials. For use in crop defense, psychological deterrence, and symbolic resistance.


---

Overview: Jaybane Ammunition is a handcrafted projectile system composed of organic and reclaimed materials, engineered for escalating levels of non-lethal to potentially lethal deterrence. Each round is crafted with intention, from basic training munitions to psychological and physical warfare against nuisance wildlife.

Core Ingredients:

Yard Clay â€“ Local unrefined earth. Acts as the structural body.

Dog Hair â€“ Fiber reinforcement. Functions like straw in bricks.

Flour â€“ Gluten binder. Helps maintain form during drying and firing.


Base Ratio:
3 parts clay : 1 part dog hair : 1 part flour.
Mix with water to reach a thick modeling consistency.

Construction Protocol:

1. Mixing:
Combine ingredients. Knead until consistent. Adjust water sparingly.

2. Shaping:
Form into spheres, cones, or custom shapes. Embed cores as needed. Add texture for identification.

3. Drying:
Air-dry in shade 24â€“48 hours. Rotate for even drying. Avoid rapid sun-drying.

4. Firing (Optional):
Kiln or coal fire to ~600â€“900Â°C. Improves structural hardness. Reduces deformity.

Deployment Guidelines:

Use Type I for frequent deterrence. Non-lethal and reusable.

Type II for stubborn intruders. Effective against bold jays or larger pests.

Type III in open zones. Causes wide reaction without requiring precision.

Type IV only when symbolic fear or extreme defense is necessary. Not for daily use.

Notes & Warnings:

Always test rounds on cardboard or soft fruit before deployment.

Avoid firing glass rounds at animals.

Clay rounds can ricochet. Always check surroundings.

Store rounds in dry, sealed containers.

Jaybane doesnâ€™t end with ammunition. Itâ€™s a doctrine of garden sovereignty. Every lettuce defended, every tomato reclaimed, builds the myth. Make every shot count.



The Jaybane Field Guide is now laid out as a formal document. You can edit, expand, or print it from here. Let me know if youâ€™d like to add illustrations, a foreword, loadout diagrams, or even battle logs to record confirmed deterrence events.
